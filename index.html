    <h1>The Magician Of Hockey</h1>
    <p>Major Dhyan Chand (29 August 1905 â€“ 3 December 1979) was an Indian field hockey player, widely regarded as one of the greatest field hockey players in history.He was known for his extraordinary ball control and goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964</p>
    <p>Known as The Wizard or The Magician of hockey for his superb ball control, Chand played internationally from 1926 to 1949, where he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography, Goal, and over 1000 goals in his entire domestic and international career. BBC called him the "hockey's equivalent of Muhammad Ali".The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan in 1956.His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year. India's highest sporting honour, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is named after him.</p>
    <h1>Final Years</h1>
    <p>Chand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526, but was apparently not granted a regular commission.In 1951 he was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators.After 34 years of service, Chand retired from the Indian Army on 29 August 1956 as a lieutenant (acting captain).The Government of India honoured him the same year by conferring him the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour.</p>
    <p>After retirement, he taught at coaching camps at Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Later, he accepted the position of Chief Hockey Coach at the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, a post he held for several years. Chand spent his last days in his hometown of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Chand died on 3 December 1979 from liver cancer at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.He was cremated at the Jhansi Heroes ground in his hometown, after some initial problems in getting clearance. His regiment, the Punjab Regiment, accorded him full military honours.</p>
